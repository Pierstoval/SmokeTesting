# SmokeTesting with Symfony

A very small lib that you can use to create tons of smoke tests for your Symfony application.

Particularly useful for big untested Symfony legacy projects.

## Why smoke testing

[Smoke testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)) is a way to quickly assert whether your project is viable for *unit* or *functional* testing.

To smoke-test an app, it is common to execute many parts of the app itself and just make sure it doesn't throw errors.

> An analogy could be that it is like starting the engine of your car to make sure it starts and doesn't throw smoke nor explode (hence "smoke" testing ðŸ˜‰), but not individually testing the windshield wipers, brake, or gear box.

In the world of web development, smoke testing is often about opening all pages of a website and making sure they don't return an HTTP server error (status code > 500), and sometimes testing 404 or other HTTP client error codes.

Another **really important** use of smoke testing is when you work on big legacy projects that have no tests and/or no documentation.<br>
Running basic smoke testing (like when using this library) **comes with a very low cost** and can **check the whole project's average health**.<br>
Plus, adding **manual testing** (see the [Smoke-test routes manually](#smoke-test-routes-manually) section) allows you to have **more control** and more **advanced settings** for your tests (such as adding HTTP headers, making expectations on page content, etc.).

## Installation

```
composer require --dev pierstoval/smoke-testing
```

## Usage

* Configure PHPUnit for your application (see the [Testing](https://symfony.com/doc/current/testing.html) section on Symfony docs).
* Create a test case extending Symfony's `WebTestCase` class (the base for functional testing in Symfony).

Now choose between [smoke testing all your routes at once](#smoke-test-all-routes) or [smoke testing routes manually](#smoke-test-routes-manually) (see below).

### Smoke test ALL routes

* Add the `SmokeTestAllRoutes` trait to your class.
* Run PHPUnit.

Example:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Tests;

use Pierstoval\SmokeTesting\SmokeTestAllRoutes;
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Test\WebTestCase;

class AllRoutesTest extends WebTestCase
{
    use SmokeTestAllRoutes; // This does all the trick!
}
```

That's it!

You need to set this up only once in your project.

#### What does it do?

The `SmokeTestAllRoutes` trait already contains a PHPUnit test that will **find all HTTP routes** of your application by using the Symfony Router, and will **run a simple HTTP request on each** by using Symfony's HTTP Client.<br>
If the request returns an HTTP status code **>= 500**, the test will **fail**.<br>
**Otherwise**, even with HTTP 400 or 404, the test will **suceed**.

As said in the intro, 4** HTTP codes can be perfectly normal and expected, like when you have some sections of your app that depend on authentication.

> On a personal note, I recommend you create tests for at least 400/401/403 codes on your projects.
> Most of them are based on client input that has to be validated, or authentication, which are critical entry points of your application, and therefore must be thoroughly tested.

### Smoke-test routes **manually**

Instead of (or conjointedly to) checking all routes of your app, you can run a list of URLs of your choice and have control on all request parameters and test assertions/expectations.

> That is the method I would recommend for a gentle and graceful start with smoke testing,
> because this method gives you a lot of control on your tests, allowing you to create tests that are way more exhaustive than simple smoke tests (making them more like functional tests, in the end).

* Add the `FunctionalSmokeTester` trait to your class.
* Create functional test data using the `FunctionalTestData` class (see example below).
* Execute the `$this->runFunctionalTest` method in your test case with your `FunctionalTestData` instance as first argument.
* Run PHPUnit.

Example:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Tests;

use Pierstoval\SmokeTesting\FunctionalSmokeTester;
use Pierstoval\SmokeTesting\FunctionalTestData;
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Test\WebTestCase;

class AllRoutesTest extends WebTestCase
{
    use FunctionalSmokeTester; // Allows using the "$this->runFunctionalTest()" method.
    
    public function testGet200(): void
    {
        $this->runFunctionalTest(
            FunctionalTestData::withUrl('/my-route')
                ->expectRouteName('my_successful_route')
                ->expectStatusCode(200)
                ->expectTextToBePresent('Hello world!')
        );
    }
}
```

For convenience, you can also create a **data provider** to execute only the URLs you need:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Tests;

use Pierstoval\SmokeTesting\FunctionalSmokeTester;
use Pierstoval\SmokeTesting\FunctionalTestData;
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Test\WebTestCase;

class AllRoutesTest extends WebTestCase
{
    use FunctionalSmokeTester;

    /**
     * @dataProvider provideTestUrls
     */
    public function testMyUrls(FunctionalTestData $testData): void
    {
        $this->runFunctionalTest($testData);
    }
    
    public function provideTestUrls(): \Generator
    {
        yield '/my-route' => FunctionalTestData::withUrl('/my-route')
                ->expectRouteName('my_successful_route')
                ->expectStatusCode(200)
                ->expectTextToBePresent('Hello world!');

        yield '/my-other-route' => FunctionalTestData::withUrl('/my-other-route')
                ->withHttpHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer 2d5b0cfb531745668')
                ->expectRouteName('my_other_route')
                ->expectStatusCode(200)
                ->expectTextToBePresent('{"message": "Bonjour!"}');
    }
}
```
